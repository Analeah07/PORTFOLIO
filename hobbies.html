        <h1>INSTRUMENTS</h1>

        <p>Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent. 
          Being an introvert, music become my hobby since I was small. Listening to music literally 
          increase my fighting spirit, and this two instrument: the keyboard and guitar are the 
          instrument that I play here in our chapel. I am a part of music team here in our church.
          And this is my humbly way to give back the talent that God has given me.</p>

        <h1>CANVA EDITING</h1>
        <img class="hob1" src="./images/canva.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>As pandemic arise in the world, I thought of a hobby that I can do while 
          I<span>&#x27;</span>m home and someone told me that I can edit designs on canva. I love taking 
          pictures and editing pictures. I<span>&#x27;</span>m not an expert right now but I hope someday 
          I will be good to it.</p>

      <div class="My_Hobby">
        <h1>PLAYING WITH DOG</h1>
        <img class="hob1" src="./images/dog.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself. 
          When I was little, I didn<span>&#x27;</span>t see the value of dogs until I had one. 
          The day won<span>&#x27;</span>t past that I don<span>&#x27;</span>t see my dog, I love them because they are 
          protective when it comes to their owner, even though they can<span>&#x27;</span>t speak but you 
          can see on their eyes that they listen and feel what you<span>&#x27;</span>re going through. 
          They ease the stress and pain that I experience.</p>
